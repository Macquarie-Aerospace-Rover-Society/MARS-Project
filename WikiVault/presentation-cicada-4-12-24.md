### What does space heritage mean
- Matt
	- Worked at atlassian
	- Wanted to work with rocket launches
	- Putting something on a rocket was to demonstrate they can provide that service
	- Nick got some thanks
- Ann
	- Ann did customer discovery
	- found 1/3 of satts are failing in Space
	- Space/rocket science is hard in unexpected ways
	- flight heritage proves they are the experts, and that they are not the 1/3
- Robbie
	- On-orbit compute now needed due to shortage of downlink routes for data
	- Australia has pathetic manufacturing capacity
		- 102ns in the world
	- Building sovereign capability
- Most of the people in the room have sent something to space :|

### Partnerships question
- Ann
	- PArtnerships?
- Matt
	- Good partnerships are rooted in good communication
	- New PArtnerships are like a new date
	- Show-n-Tells the payload sent to Space
		- Fabricating a prototype was both cheap and demonstrated capability
- Robbie
	- Relationships must not be transactional
	- Properly explaining the project increases the speed of Uni/Industry response

### IOC 2025 could be a platform for future industry growth, what does IOC 2025 support
- Matt
	- "We just need more people"
	- Space industry needs to be better integrated ino wider Industry
- Ann
	- IOC will have lots of collaboration
	- Together we rise, mentality for 2025
		- "We are considered like cockroaches atm" in terms of survival
- Robbie
	- US perspective
		- 3 Rs: redundancy, resiliancy, return
		- US launch capacity is at its limit
	- Australia needs to "get stuff done"

### We need more space cockroaches to RRR for IOC 2025
