# Presentation for SRN

## House cleaning

### Intros
- Jake
- Johnothan
	- space domain awareness JCO
- Kushi
	- CSIRO
- Kaylee
	- SIRI (sydney interplanetary rover initiative)
	- Working on NASA rover
	- Started company to send something to the moon
		- Astria
		- measure radioative decay of drugs
	- ???
		- Cube sats
			- operating and controlling them
		- Building a sattelite

## What got you interested in space
- Jake
	- Extracurricular
- Johnothan
	- Always loved space since a kid
	- Joined as many space things as possible
	- Thinks student projects are way better than formal
- Kushi
	- Studied space and paleo science at uni
- Kaylee
	- Conferences are what got her interested
		- Now "drags" her team along
	- Space generation advisory council SGAC (Recommended)
- ???
	- Exposure through uni
	- tried to build a rover

## Question to industry
- Not for profits run most industry asscociations
	- good for interships
	- Can take a mining connection then migrate to space

## When did you get interested in space
- Someone wants to have a job that doesn't exist (job on mars)
	- Is trying to create that job so he can take it
	- Can be done in Australia Now
- Another loved being imersed in things unknown
- Kaylee likes being partly responsible for creating the australian space industry.
	- wants to enable the space industry
- German guy says "there are not ridgid structures in australia"
	- Rules are being made now (Kaylee)
	- Masters was what he used to move into the career he wanted.

## What is it like having a job on the cutting edge
- "Politics of space" ffs...
- Space as a critical infastructure
	- Hard to rebuild if damaged (John)
	- Replacement satts take a long time to rebuild

## Impacts of changes regarding Aus interest in space
- Universities not training engineers properly, neccessitating retraining by industry
- Wasted potential
	- Building a satt, hardest part was fighting the university
	- JP1092 got cut?
	- Flip-Flops make it hard to get things into space
		- Human interface is difficult
- Science / Engineering communicaiton is greatly needed
	- under 50% of people know about Australian space agency
	- People don't recognise how important it is for their daily lives
- Problem regarding industry placements for engineering
	- Limit on internships hours limited the utility of interns

## Projects be seen as building future talent
- Industry wants more projects
- Get non-Engineering students involved (marketing, media, education, regulatory)
	- Sounds like they want to start a movement
- Try to build projects in a way that skills can be levereraged to be transferable

## What does success look like
- Lasting and meaningful change
	- Talk to non-stem friends to raise awareness of the industry
- Aus space industry successful enough that there isn't a backup plan needed.
- ASRC risk in space operations
	- Students working on projects is a risk
- Need more startups that draw heavily from students
- Reluctance to hire students stems from the students not having hands on experience for a particular task
	- requires on the job training
	- System development indicates how mature the industry is
		- checkpoints
- Having big players assit in building supply chains
	- Big player want bespoke products, but don't want to work with startups
	- Local supply chains
	- SEAR was paid to build a space industry database
		- Supply chain mapping tools
		- 80 members, interships are available
			- Jobs board, SEAR academy website
			- Well designed course
- Extend chains from university into High Schools
	- Uni students want industry jobs, high school studnets want university study!!!!!

## Closing
- Blue Marble space?
- RPC "plug": submissions for research to be published internationaly
- Kaylee: IOC helping IOCC, wants to send a student team to set up a both.
	- Expression of interest.
