There is the possibility that while editing files in this wiki a race condition arises. This occurs when 2 authors are working on the same file at the same time, if this occurs try working asynchronously using git. Or work on separate files.

# TLDR
There is text editor integration on SharePoint use that for collaborative editing.
If you are having problems editing using Obsidian [[Communication|notify someone]].
