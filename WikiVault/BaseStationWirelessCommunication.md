"The antenna to the rocket-M from there it goes to the router, from the router it connects to the switch and then every laptop or device inside the base station connects to the switch. The router is connected to the chosen antenna and wireless communication either 2.4/5Ghz via Rocket-M Access-Point. This communicates with the rover wirelessly which is within the Sandbox."
