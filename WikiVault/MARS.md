# Macquarie Aerospace Rover Society
Macquarie Rover is an exciting, student-led initiative offering a multi-disciplinary experience. Our mission is to provide hands-on opportunities for students to contribute to the development of a semi-autonomous lunar rover, gearing up to compete in the Australian Rover Challenge in Adelaide. For context, UTS started their team two years ago, and both USYD and UNSW have expressed interest in joining.
